## Registration

In-person attendance at the conference requires no registration: feel free to drop in on panels, and even individual papers, according to your interests and availability. Those who are unable to attend in person are welcome to do so virtually via Zoom, in which case please make sure to register using this [link](https://utexas.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0kdeysrD8sG9D6q260vqb6cTkJDbWU8M1m). Online attendees will need to sign into a Zoom account in order to gain access to the meeting.
