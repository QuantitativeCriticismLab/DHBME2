## About DH Beyond Modern English

Recent trends in the study of literature have seen a transformation in the kinds of textual corpus examined and a concomitant change in the analytical methods applied to these corpora. Common to the digital humanities, world literature, and other current approaches to literary research is an order-of-magnitude enlargement in the scale of analysis, whether entire centuries of novelistic production or even corpora containing millions of books spanning numerous genres. The quantitative resources and techniques that have enabled this development have been limited largely to modern and Anglophone contexts, two reasons for which are the bias towards the English language within commercial and technical fields, and the greater availability of modern texts, especially in digitized form.

DH Beyond Modern English is a two-part conference on the theme of computational approaches to the study of premodern and non-Western literature. The conference, held at Dartmouth College in Spring 2019 and the University of Texas at Austin in Spring 2022, features participants drawn from a variety of disciplines and linguistic traditions, including Arabic, Bengali, Celtic, Chinese, Coptic, English, Japanese, Latin, Ancient Greek, Old English, Russian, Sanskrit, and Spanish. The conference (and a planned edited volume) will sketch a future for the field that encompasses philology, world literature, distant reading, and cultural evolution.
